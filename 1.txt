1.a) SMA计算公式：SMA = (Σ of prices over n days) / n。作用：用于平滑价格数据，识别趋势，生成买入/卖出信号。\nb) SMA计算：过去10天收盘价：[12, 12.2, 11.8, 11.5, 11, 10.8, 10.5, 10, 9.8, 9.5]；和 = 112.8；SMA = 11.28元。止损点：95% of SMA = 10.716元，当价格跌破此点时触发止损。\nc) SMA优点：计算简单，易理解；缺点：对近期数据权重相同，可能滞后。EMA优点：给予近期数据更多权重，响应更快；缺点：计算复杂，可能过度反应。边界情形：高波动市场中，SMA可能错过信号，EMA可能导致频繁止损。

3.(a) Learning motivation is the internal drive that prompts individuals to engage in educational activities; it can influence study mode choice by making full-time study more appealing if motivated by career goals.\n(b) Motivation score = (career_advancement + skill_improvement + personal_interest) / 3; for given ratings, score = (7 + 5 + 8) / 3 ≈ 6.67.\n(c) Motivation is the drive for action, while educational goals are specific objectives; economic factors like high unemployment may amplify motivation by increasing perceived need, but for low-motivation students, it might not affect as much.
7.a) Defines mean reversion and derives the autocorrelation formula.\nb) Calculates autocorrelation using given data and applies threshold to detsermine mean reversion absence.\n

12.a) Algorithmic trading involves using computer programs to execute trades automatically based on predefined rules. Key components include strategy logic (e.g., entry and exit conditions), execution engine (handling order execution), and risk management (controlling losses).\nb) Formula for moving average: short MA = average of last n days' prices, long MA = average of last m days' prices. Crossover occurs when short MA crosses long MA. Calculation: short MA on Day 5 = (152 + 153)/2 = 152.5, long MA on Day 5 = (150 + 152 + 148 + 155 + 153)/5 = 151.6; no crossover since 152.5 > 151.6.\nc) Algorithmic trading is faster and more accurate due to automation, while traditional trading relies on human decision-making and is slower. Boundary conditions, like high volatility, can cause false signals or slippage in algorithmic strategies, leading to potential losses if not managed with risk controls.
